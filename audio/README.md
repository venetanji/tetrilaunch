# Audio masters — deliberately not in git

**This folder is gitignored.** The generated originals live outside the repo;
only the processed, shipped assets in `app/public/audio/` are committed.

## Why

Audio was 23 MB of a 36 MB repository, and the six largest objects in the
history were all mp3s. The plan is roughly ten tracks, which would take the
masters alone past 39 MB — and git history never shrinks, so every regenerated
take keeps its old blob forever. Iterate three times on ten tracks and the clone
carries all thirty.

The masters are also recoverable: they are in the Suno account that produced
them, and they are only needed when re-trimming or adding a sound. The shipped
assets, by contrast, must be committed — CI has no guaranteed ffmpeg, and they
are what `cap sync` copies into the app.

So: **derived assets in git, masters out of it.**

## Where the masters live

> **Fill this in.** Wherever you keep them — a Drive folder, Dropbox, an
> external disk — put the location here so the next person (or the next laptop)
> can find them. This file is committed precisely so that pointer survives.

## Layout

Filenames are the *code* names, not the generator's. An effect is named after
the game callback that fires it (`GameEvents` in `app/src/game/game.ts`), and
that name carries through to `app/public/audio/` and to the `playFx()` call, so
there is no translation step anywhere.

```
audio/
  fx/        one-shots, trimmed to their first transient
             shoot, impact, lineClear, pieceLost, settleStart,
             cryoShatter, bondBreak, bondBreak2, reloadReady
  stingers/  20–25s pieces, never trimmed, kept stereo
             bayClear, gameOver, gameOver2, refit
  tracks/    looping beds; these keep their SONG titles, since the track's
             name is a real thing and its role is an assignment that can
             change (the mapping lives in scripts/prepare-audio.mjs)
```

Renaming a generated file on the way in is the step where you decide what it
is. Anything unrecognised is reported and not shipped, rather than guessed at.

## Regenerating

```bash
cd app && npm run audio:prepare
```

Trims each effect to its first sound, levels everything to −3 dBFS, folds
effects to mono, strips cover art, and writes `app/public/audio/`. It needs
`ffmpeg` on PATH, and prints the trim window it chose for every effect — check
that column, because the trim is a heuristic over generated audio and will
eventually pick wrong. `OVERRIDES` in the script is the escape hatch.

Commit the resulting `app/public/audio/` changes; that is the half that ships.
